      # The default layout is 'us'. It will be installed anyway, even it is not
      # in list.
      #
      # NOTE: The 'us' and 'en' are the same; 'en' will be converted to 'us'.

      # but only the 'us' exists in `/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/`.

      # NOTE: The UTF-8 is the default, so the '.utf8' suffix is not required!
      #
      # For example, these lists are equal:

      # - en

      # NOTE: A virtual console supports switching of only 2 keyboard layouts
      # via keymaps. Since the default 'us' layout is always set, the only 1
      # additional layout is available. The first non-default list item will be
      # picked for this purpose, if exists. So list items order is important!
