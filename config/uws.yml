    # If this list is empty, then the `locale.list` will be used to determine
    # related layouts automatically.
    #
    # The default layout is 'us'. It will be installed anyway, even it is not
    # in list.
    #
    # NOTE: The 'us' and 'en' are the same; 'en' will be converted to 'us'.
    # Both 'en' and 'us' can be found in the `localectl list-keymaps` output,
    # but only the 'us' exists in `/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/`.
    #
    # NOTE: The UTF-8 is the default, so the '.utf8' suffix is not required!
    #
    # For example, these lists are equal:
    #
    # - en
    # - us
    # - es
    # - ru.utf8

    # and
    #
    # - es
    # - ru

    # NOTE: A virtual console supports switching of only 2 keyboard layouts via
    # keymaps. Since the default 'us' layout is always set, the only 1
    # additional layout is available. The first non-default list item will be
    # picked for this purpose, if exists. So list items order is important!
